# We need to allow for application to run the particular streamer service
# The way to enable this is to add specific privilege into /etc/sudoers.d (no restart of sudo service needed afterwards)

# A good guide on sudoers syntax and handling is available here:
# https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-edit-the-sudoers-file
# Strongly recommend to use visudo command for this operation:
# $ sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/91-streamer-service
# and provide privilege for the lsfusion user to run the only three commands as root without password:

lsfusion ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl status streamer.service
lsfusion ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl start streamer.service
lsfusion ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl stop streamer.service

# After editing and installing the service try according sudo command from the lsfusion user:
# $ sudo -u lsfusion sudo systemctl status streamer.service
# It will ask for a password for this user, so need to set it up, despite lsfusion is a system user with no login
